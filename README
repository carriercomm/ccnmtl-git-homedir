This contains the files that CCNMTL uses to manage their local GIT repo.

Use:
./create <new_repo>.git

to create a new repo.  
The Repo is non-bare so push scripts can add tags to the repository.

the __git_nonbare_template/ makes each repo run ~git/real_post_update.sh
after a push into the repository.

This keeps the non-bare working checkout in the proper state to be pushed/pulled from.
We also have a hook to post the commit to our IRC channel, which is useful to keep
tabs on what's happening.

Take a look at:
sample_deploy_script.sh
for how we deploy from our GIT repository.  For a better deployment experience, still,
